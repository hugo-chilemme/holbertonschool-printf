# _printf - The twin brother!

Dear printf, I am writing to you on repo to tell you that you are an example to copy, to copy perhaps for the better!

### How to use it 🤔

1. Include main.h in your file

2. Just use it as it was printf but with a dash in front! `_printf("Hello %s !", "World");`

### You can use it 🏀

`%s — For string (char *)`

`%c — For char (char)`

### They are on their way 🚚

`%i — For integer (int)`

`%d — For integer (int)`

`%b — For binary conversion (int)`
